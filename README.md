# chevron.filters

Filters is a system to write, instantiate, and/or mix-in functions for
filtering either scalar values or arrays of values. The two provided are meant
to be common, but the system itself is meant to be quite extensible.

There is the issue of using two or more of these filters as traits in the same
class. The implementing class must resolve the conflicting method names. This
is inconvenient but expected with trait usage.

Peruse the tests or, if present, the examples directory to see usage.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/chevron-filters) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `~2.0`.
